# Lab: Implementing identity services and Group Policy

## Scenario

You are working as an administrator at Contoso Ltd. The company is expanding its business with several new locations. The Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Administration team is currently evaluating methods available in Windows Server for rapid and remote domain controller deployment. The team is also searching for a way to automate certain AD DS administrative tasks. Additionally, the team wants to establish configuration management based on Group Policy Objects (GPO) and enterprise certification authority (CA) hierarchy.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you’ll be able to:

- Deploy a new domain controller on Server Core.

- Configure Group Policy.

- Deploy, manage, and use digital certificates.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab setup

Virtual machines: **WS-011T00A-SEA-DC1**, **WS-011T00A-SEA-SVR1**, **WS-011T00A-SEA-ADM1**, and **WS-011T00A-SEA-CL1**

User Name: **Contoso\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

## Lab setup

1. Select  **SEA-DC1**.
1. Sign in using the following credentials:

   - User name: **Administrator**
   - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
   - Domain: **Contoso**


## Exercise 1: Deploying a new domain controller on Server Core

### Task 1: Deploy AD DS on a new Windows Server Core server

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, select **Start**, and then select **Server Manager**.
1. In **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Windows PowerShell**.
1. At the command prompt in the Windows PowerShell command-line interface, enter the following command, and then select Enter:
	
   ```powershell
   Install-WindowsFeature –Name AD-Domain-Services –ComputerName SEA-SVR1
   ```
1. Enter the following command to verify that the AD DS role is installed on **SEA-SVR1**, and then select Enter:
	
   ```PowerShell
   Get-WindowsFeature –ComputerName SEA-SVR1
   ```
1. In the output of the previous command, search for **Active Directory Domain Services**. Verify that this check box is selected. Search for **Remote Server Administration Tools**. Notice the **Role Administration Tools** node below it, and then notice the **AD DS and AD LDS Tools** node.

   > **Note**: Under the **AD DS and AD LDS Tools** node, only **Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell** has been installed and not the graphical tools, such as the Active Directory Administrative Center. If you centrally manage your servers, you will not usually need these on each server. If you want to install them, you must specify the AD DS tools by running the **Add-WindowsFeature** cmdlet with the **RSAT-ADDS** command name.

   > **Note**: You might need to wait a brief time after the installation process completes before verifying that the AD DS role has installed. If you do not observe the expected results from the **Get-WindowsFeature** command, you can try again after a few minutes.

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, in **Server Manager**, select the **All Servers** view.
1. On the **Manage** menu, select **Add Servers**.
1. In the **Add Servers** dialog box, maintain the default settings, and then select **Find Now**.
1. In the **Active Directory** list of servers, select **SEA-SVR1**, select the arrow to add it to the **Selected** list, and then select **OK**.
1. On **SEA-ADM1**, ensure that the installation of the AD DS role on **SEA-SRV1** is complete and that the server was added to **Server Manager**. Then select the **Notifications** flag symbol.
1. Note the post-deployment configuration of **SEA-SVR1**, and then select the **Promote this server to a domain controller** link.
1. In the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**, on the **Deployment Configuration** page, under **Select the deployment operation**, verify that **Add a domain controller to an existing domain** is selected.
1. Ensure that the ```Contoso.com``` domain is specified, and then in the **Supply the credentials to perform this operation** section, select **Change**.
1. In the **Credentials for deployment operation** dialog box, in the **User name** box, enter **Contoso\Administrator**, and then in the **Password** box, enter **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Select **OK**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Domain Controller Options** page, select the **Domain Name System (DNS) server** and **Global Catalog (GC)** check boxes. Ensure that the **Read-only domain controller (RODC)** check box is cleared.
1. In the **Type the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password** section, enter and confirm the password **Pa55w.rd**, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **DNS Options** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Additional Options** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Paths** page, keep the default path settings for the **Database** folder, **Log files** folder, and **SYSVOL** folder, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Review Options** page, select **View script** to open the generated Windows PowerShell script.
1. In Notepad, edit the generated Windows PowerShell script:

    - Delete the comment lines that begin with the number sign (**#**).
    - Remove the **Import-Module** line.
    - Remove the grave accents (**`**) at the end of each line.
    - Remove the line breaks.

1. Now the **Install-ADDSDomainController** command and all the parameters are on one line. Place the cursor in front of the line, and then, on the menu, select **Select All** to select the whole line. On the menu, select **Edit**, and then select **Copy**.
1. Switch to the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**, and then select **Cancel**.
1. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes** to cancel the wizard.
1. At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command:

   ```PowerShell
   Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR1 { }
   ```
1. Place the cursor between the braces (**{ }**), and then paste the content of the copied script line from the clipboard. The whole line should now be as follows:
	
   ```PowerShell
   Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR1 {Install-ADDSDomainController -NoGlobalCatalog:\$false -CreateDnsDelegation:\$false -Credential (Get-Credential) -CriticalReplicationOnly:\$false -DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -DomainName "Contoso.com" -InstallDns:\$true -LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" -NoRebootOnCompletion:\$false -SiteName "Default-First-Site-Name" -SysvolPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" -Force:\$true}
   ```
1. Select Enter to start the command.
1. In the **Windows PowerShell Credential Request** dialog box, enter **Contoso\Administrator** in the **User name** box, enter **Pa55w.rd** in the **Password** box, and then select **OK**.
1. When prompted for the password, in the **SafeModeAdministratorPassword** text box, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then select Enter.
1. When prompted for confirmation, in the **Confirm SafeModeAdministratorPassword** text box, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then select Enter.
1. Wait until the command runs and the **Status Success** message is returned. The **SEA-SVR1** virtual machine restarts.
1. Close Notepad without saving the file.
1. After **SEA-SVR1** restarts, on **SEA-ADM1**, switch to **Server Manager**, and on the left side, select the **AD DS** node. Note that **SEA-SVR1** has been added as a server and that the warning notification has disappeared.

> **Note**: You might have to select **Refresh**.

## Task 2: Manage objects in AD DS

1. Switch to **SEA-ADM1**.
1. Switch to **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
1. Create an OU called **Seattle** in the domain by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name:"Seattle" -Path:"DC=Contoso,DC=com" -ProtectedFromAccidentalDeletion:$true -Server:"SEA-DC1.Contoso.com"
   ```

1. Create a user account for **Ty Carlson** in the **Seattle** OU by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   New-ADUser -Name Ty -DisplayName "Ty Carlson" -GivenName Ty -Surname Carlson -Path "ou=Seattle,dc=contoso,dc=com"
   ```

1. Set the password for the account by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ADAccountPassword Ty
   ```

1. When you receive a prompt for the current password, select Enter.
1. When you receive a prompt for the desired password, enter **Pa55w.rd**, and then select Enter.
