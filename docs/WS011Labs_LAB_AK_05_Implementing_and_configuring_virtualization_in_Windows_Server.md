# Lab: Implementing and configuring virtualization in Windows Server

## Scenario

Contoso is a global engineering and manufacturing company with its head office in Seattle, USA. An IT office and data center are in Seattle to support the Seattle location and other locations. Contoso recently deployed a Windows Server 2019 server and client infrastructure.

Because of many physical servers being currently underutilized, the company plans to expand virtualization to optimize the environment. Because of this, you decide to perform a proof of concept to validate how Hyper-V can be used to manage a virtual machine environment. Also, the Contoso DevOps team wants to explore container technology to determine whether they can help reduce deployment times for new applications and to simplify moving applications to the cloud. You plan to work with the team to evaluate Windows Server containers and to consider providing Internet Information Services (Web services) in a container.

### Exercise 2: Installing and configuring containers

#### Task 1: Install Docker on Windows Server

1. On SEA-ADM1, from the taskbar, open **Microsoft Edge**.
1. On the Favorites bar, select **Windows Admin Center**.
1. In the Windows Security box, enter the following credentials:

   - User name: **Contoso\Administrator**
   - Password: **Pa55w.rd**
1. On the **All connections** page, select **SEA-SVR1**.
1. On the **Specify your credentials** page, select **Use another account for this connection**. Provide the **Contoso\Administrator** credentials, and then select **Continue**.
1. In the **Tools** list, select **PowerShell**. Provide the **Contoso\Administrator** credentials, and then select **Enter**. You are now connected to SEA-SVR1 using a Remote PowerShell connection.

   > **Note**: The Powershell connection in **WAC** may be slow due to nested virtualization used in the lab, so an alternate method is to use **Enter-PSSession -computername SEA-SVR1** from a Powershell window on **SEA-ADM1**.

1. At the PowerShell command prompt enter the following command and then select Enter:

   `Install-Module -Name DockerMsftProvider -Repository PSGallery -Force`

1. At the NuGet Provider prompt, enter **Y** for yes and then select Enter.
1. At the PowerShell command prompt enter the following command and then select Enter:

   `Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider`

1. At the confirmation prompt, enter **A** for Yes to All and then select Enter.
1. After the installation is complete, restart the computer by using the following command:

   `Restart-Computer -Force`

#### Task 2: Install and run a Windows container

1. After SEA-SVR1 restarts reconnect the PowerShell tool and provide the Contoso\Administrator credentials.
1. Verify the installed version of Docker by using the following command:

   `Get-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider`

   > **Note**: You may need to run **Start-Service -name Docker** before running the next commands.

1. To verify whether any Docker images are currently pulled, use the following command:

   `Docker images`

   Notice that there are no images in the local repository store.
1. To review docker base images from the online Microsoft repository, use the following command:

   `Docker search Microsoft`

   Notice the variety of base images each representing various runtime scenarios.

   > **Note**: You may disregard any errors and continue with the next step.

1. To download a server core image, with IIS, that matches the host operating system, run the following command:

   `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2019`

   > **Note**: This download may take more than 15 minutes to complete.

1. To confirm the Docker image that is currently pulled, use the following command:

   `Docker images`

   Notice that there is now an image listed in the local repository store.

1. To run the container, enter the following command:

   `Docker run -d -p 80:80 --name ContosoSite mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis:windowsservercore-ltsc2019 cmd`

   This command runs the IIS image as a background service (-d) and configures networking such that port 80 of the container host maps to port 80 of the container.

1. Enter the following command to retrieve the IP address information of the container host:

   `ipconfig`

   Note the IPv4 address of the Ethernet adapter named vEthernet (nat). This is the address of the new container. Make a note of the IPv4 address of the Ethernet adapter named **Ethernet**. This is the IP address of the Host (SEA-SVR1).

1. In Microsoft Edge, open another tab and then enter **```<http://172.16.10.12>```**. Observe the default IIS page.

1. In the remote PowerShell session, enter the following command:

   `docker ps`

   This command provides information on the container that is currently running on SEA-SVR1. Take note of the container ID as you will use it to stop the Container.

1. In the remote PowerShell session, enter the following command:

   `docker stop <ContainerID>`

1. Rerun the `docker ps` command to confirm that the container has stopped.

#### Task 3: Use Windows Admin Center to manage containers

1. On SEA-ADM1, ensure that SEA-SVR1 is targeted in the Windows Admin Center and then select the **Containers** tool.
1. Browse through each of the **Summary**, **Containers**, **Images**, **Networks**, and **Volumes** tabs.

### Exercise 2 results

After this exercise, you should have installed Docker on Windows Server and installed and run a Windows container containing web services.
