# Lab answer key: Implementing Hyper-V Replica and Windows Server Backup

## Exercise1: Implementing Hyper-V Replica

### Task 1: Configure a replica on both host machines

1. On **SEA-ADM1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Select **Start**, and then enter **powershell**. Right-click or access the context menu for Windows PowerShell, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    $cred=Get-Credential
    ```

   When prompted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

     ```powershell
     $sess = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName sea-svr1.contoso.com
     ```

   Next, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession $sess
   ```
  
   You should get a [`sea-svr1.contoso.com`] title in your command prompt. From this point, all the commands that you enter run on **SEA-SVR1**.
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

   You'll receive the properties of this firewall rule. Search for the value of the *Enabled* variable. It should be set to **False**. To enable **SEA-SVR1** as a replication host, you must enable this firewall rule.
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enable-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-Netfirewallrule -displayname "Hyper-V Replica HTTP Listener (TCP-In)"
   ```

   You'll receive the properties of this firewall rule. Search for the value of the *Enabled* variable. Now it should be set to **True**.
1. To configure **SEA-SVR1** as a Replica server for **Hyper-V Replica**, enter the following command in the PowerShell window, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-VMReplicationServer -ReplicationEnabled $true -AllowedAuthenticationType Kerberos -ReplicationAllowedFromAnyServer $true -DefaultStorageLocation c:\ReplicaStorage
   ```

1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VMReplicationServer
   ```
  
   You should get the configuration setting that you configured in the previous step, which is as follows:

   - **RepEnabled:True**
   - **AuthType:Kerb**
   - **KerAuthPort:80**
   - **CertAuthPort:443**
   - **AllowAnyServer:True**
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    Get-VM
    ```

    **SEA-CORE1** should be listed as a virtual machine (VM) that's configured on this Hyper-V server. Leave the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window open.
1. Select **Start**, and then enter **powershell**.
    Right-click or access the context menu for Windows PowerShell, and then select **Run as administrator**. This will open another instance of Windows PowerShell.
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    $cred=Get-Credential
    ```

    When prompted, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** window, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    $sess1 = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName sea-svr2.contoso.com
    ```

    Next, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

    ```powershell
    Enter-PSSession $sess1
    ```

    You should get a [`sea-svr2.contoso.com`] title in your command prompt. From this point, all commands that you enter run on **SEA-SVR2**.

1. Repeat steps 5 through 10 in the PowerShell window where you have a session opened on **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**. This will configure **SEA-SRV2** for **Hyper-V Replica**. In step 10, you should get no result when running the **Get-VM** command because no VMs are configured on **SEA-SVR2**.
1. Leave both PowerShell sessions open for the next task.

### Task 2: Configure replication

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Enable-VMReplication SEA-CORE1 -ReplicaServerName SEA-SVR2.contoso.com -ReplicaServerPort 80 -AuthenticationType Kerberos -computername SEA-SVR1.contoso.com
   ```

1. After you have verified that you didn't receive any error message from the previous command, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMInitialReplication SEA-CORE1
   ```

   This starts the initial replication process for VM **SEA-CORE1**, from **SEA-SVR1** to **SEA-SVR2**.

1. After you have verified that you didn't receive any error message from the previous command, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VMReplication
   ```

   This command retrieves the replication status.

   In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **InitialReplicationInProgress**. Wait for 4&ndash;5 minutes, and then repeat this command. Verify that the value in the **State** column is **Replicating**. Don't proceed to the next steps until you get this value. Additionally, ensure that **Primary server** is set to **SEA-SVR1** and **ReplicaServer** is set to **SEA-SVR2**.

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   get-vm
   ```

   Verify that you now have the **SEA-CORE1** VM on **SEA-SVR2**. This means that the VM successfully replicated.

1. Leave both Windows PowerShell sessions open for the next task.

### Task 3: Validate failover

1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMFailover -Prepare -VMName SEA-CORE1 -computername SEA-SVR1.contoso.com
   ```

   When prompted, enter **Y**, and then select Enter. This command prepares for the planned failover of **SEA-CORE1** by replicating any pending changes.
1. Switch to the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VMFailover -VMName SEA-CORE1 -computername SEA-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   When prompted, enter **Y**, and then select Enter. This command fails over the replica VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-VMReplication -Reverse -VMName SEA-CORE1 -computername SEA-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   This command switches the replica VM to a primary VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have the remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Start-VM -VMName SEA-CORE1 -computername SEA-SVR2.contoso.com
   ```

   This command starts the VM that has been switched from a replica VM to a primary VM.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VM
   ```

   In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **Running**.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-VMReplication
   ```

   In the result table, search for the value in the **State** column. It should be **Replicating**. Additionally, ensure that the **Primary server** is now set to **SEA-SVR2** and that **ReplicaServer** is set to **SEA-SVR1**.
1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following command, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Stop-VM SEA-CORE1
   ```

1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr1.contoso.com`**, enter the following commands, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Exit-PSSession
   Remove-PSSession $sess
   ```

1. In the PowerShell window where you have a remote PowerShell session opened for **`sea-svr2.contoso.com`**, enter the following commands, and then select Enter:

   ```powershell
   Exit-PSSession
   Remove-PSSession $sess1
   ```

1. Close both PowerShell windows and leave the VMs running.

>**Note:** If you want to verify the results of this exercise by using GUI tools, you can start Hyper-V Manager on **SEA-ADM1**, and then add the **SEA-SVR1** and **SEA-SVR2** servers to the **Hyper-V** console. You can then verify that the **SEA-CORE1** VM exists on both **SEA-SVR1** and **SEA-SVR2** and that replication is running from **SEA-SVR2** to **SEA-SVR1**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have configured **Hyper-V Replica** and tested failover.
